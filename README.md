# IPL Win Loss Score Predictor
The main objective of this project is to develop an IPL win-loss and score predictor that will help the Management to find the best combination of player. The goal of this project is to use variety of algorithms on a comprehensive dataset of cricket match results to predict the team agnostic match outcomes. The target competition is The Indian Premier League (IPL) which is a twenty over format cricket league. We will be extracting the results of every IPL match from the years 2008 to 2018. This data will allow us to calculate arbitrary batsman and bowler statistics before every game. The models will be optimized with individual player features and then both team and player features. The models will be trained based on the data of 11 IPL seasons from 2008 to 2018. The optimal model was a simple prediction method which can predict the outcome of a match based on the opponents and the players in particular team. Although it is difficult to take into account all features that influence the results of the matches, an attempt to find the most significant features is made and various classifiers are tested to solve the problem.
